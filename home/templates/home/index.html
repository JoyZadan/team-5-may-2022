                    from
                    the people that matter to us and are too worried about the outcomes to ask for it. Here at Reach Out
                    you can
                    use this platform to start those difficult conversations anonymously. Have a read of our users

            <h2 class="green">Anna</h2>
            <p>I was scared from all the old horror stories of kids being shunned or abandoned by their friends and
                family
                for their sexuality. I used Reach Out to tell my friends that 'someone they knew' was struggling to talk
                about it. After recieving a number of encouraging messages it gave me the confidence to come out in
                person
                and shortly after told my parents! I'm finally feeling more like the real me.

            <h2 class="red">Leeroy</h2>
            <p>For a long time I felt alone in my interests. I don't enjoy football and felt left out at school because of it. 
                I used Reach Out to ask if any of the people I knew would be interested in hanging out to play boardgames. I now
            have a close circle of friends and we meet up regularly to play Dungeons and Dragons!</p>

            <h2 class="light-blue">Kate</h2>
            <p>After my husband passed away I became incredibly reclusive and scared I was a burden on the people around me. When
                I found this website I contacted the people I knew to ask for help. I was shocked at first that they accepted
                and wanted me to reach out to them for help despite not fully knowing who I was. My friendships have become deeper,
                more meaningful and I have since found the confidence in myself to try dating again.
