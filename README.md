## About
Reach Out is a project designed with the hopes of giving confidence to people who are struggling with a difficult topics of conversation by starting that conversation with someone important to them anonymously. This may include a young person who wants to talk to their parent about gender identity, someone who is suffering with mental illness and isn't confident that their friends would be willing to listen or perhaps a person who is feeling isolated and alone. We believe there are many people out there who first need to hear that their family and friends are happy for them to reach out and connect so that they can get the support they need from the people that matter most.

## UX Design and Planning

### User Stories
- As a user I want to send a message to someone I know, inviting them to talk.

- I want the message to be anonymous, it will be at my discretion to reveal my identity.

- As a website we will need users to create accounts and verify their age and email for security.

- As a user I would like to be able to change my password and delete my account.

- As a user I would like ideas on how to create my message or see examples from the past to give me confidence.

- As the initiator or the recipient of the conversation, I need the website to appear professional and trustworthy.

### Target Demographic
We hope that the project will reach a wide range of demographics unbound by race, sexuality, class, social background, the list goes on. Ultimately, it is up to the users on how they use the website and the issues they are dealing with, but we hope that with enough information and encouragement people of all varieties will make great progress on their struggles from the platform.

### Typography

### Color Scheme
We dicided upon a deep green and complimentary blue as the main colors of choice for the project. Green and Blue are said to have calming effects and are often considered refreshing, relaxing colours. Green has also been found to positively influence not only our emotions but our memories as well and Blue is often seen as a sign of stability and reliability.
