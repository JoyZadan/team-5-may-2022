            <p>We all know support is likely out there for our struggles, but sometimes we need it most
                from
                the people that matter to us and are too worried about the outcomes to ask for it. Here at Reach Out
                you can
                use this platform to start those difficult conversations anonymously. Have a read of our users

            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>I was scared from all the old horror stories of kids being shunned or abandoned by their friends and
                family
                for their sexuality. I used Reach Out to tell my friends that 'someone they knew' was struggling to talk
                about it. After recieving a number of encouraging messages it gave me the confidence to come out in
                person
                and shortly after told my parents! I haven't been happier since.
