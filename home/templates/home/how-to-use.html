            <p>I was scared from all the old horror stories of kids being shunned or abandoned by their friends and
                family
                for their sexuality. I used Reach Out to tell my friends that 'someone they knew' was struggling to talk
                about it. After recieving a number of encouraging messages it gave me the confidence to come out in
                person
                and shortly after told my parents! I'm finally feeling more like the real me.

            <p>For a long time I felt alone in my interests. I don't enjoy football and felt left out at school because
                of
                it.
                I used Reach Out to ask if any of the people I knew would be interested in hanging out to play
                boardgames. I
                now
                have a close circle of friends and we meet up regularly to play Dungeons and Dragons!</p>

            <p>After my husband passed away I became incredibly reclusive and scared I was a burden on the people around
                me.
                When
                I found this website I contacted the people I knew to ask for help. I was shocked at first that they
                accepted
                and wanted me to reach out to them for help despite not fully knowing who I was. My friendships have
                become
                deeper,
                more meaningful and I have since found the confidence in myself to try dating again.
