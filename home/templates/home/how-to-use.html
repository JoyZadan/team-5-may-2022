            <p>After my divorce I ended up living alone in an apartment closer to work. I had lost most of my friends because of what had
                happened. I reached out to the people living in my apartment block for help and couldn't tell you at the time how surprised 
                I was by the kindness of strangers. I have made many new friends and have been working hard to become better than the man I was
                before.

            <p>Whilst away at university I told my parents that someone close to them (I) was planning on transitioning. My father didn't
                respond and my mother was very dismissive and against the idea. But, with the support services I found through this site I have found the words
                and strength to speak about my feelings more confidently. Despite not getting the response I had hoped for it pushed me in the
                right direction to start making the changes I need, I am much happier with who I am. I have since come out about it to my parents
                and with the conversations we had online, I think it gave them time to reflect on what they might have seen coming.

            <p>As a single mother I had struggled with alcohol abuse for a while. I used this platform to reach out to my friends to say that I
                desperately needed help from people I could trust and that could keep the addiction I needed help fighting a secret. 
                I have recieved a huge ammount of support, I have friends who help look after my child in the evenings when I go to my AA meetings,
                I have been given a weath of information to help control my finances and I am making changes to better the lives of me and my child.
